# JoriDE

JoriDE is a Desktop Environment that I created using Openbox as a base for my JoriOS Linux distribution. It uses TInt2, Rofi, PCManFM, and Feh, and features icons and themes from macOS.

# Features
- Lightweight and fast: JoriDE is built on Openbox, a lightweight and efficient window manager. This makes it ideal for older or less powerful computers.
- Customizable: JoriDE is highly customizable. You can change the look and feel of your desktop to match your preferences.
- Mac-inspired: JoriDE features icons and themes from macOS, giving it a sleek and modern look.
- Easy to use: JoriDE is designed to be user-friendly. It is easy to navigate and find the applications you need.
